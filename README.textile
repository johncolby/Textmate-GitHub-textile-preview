h1. TextMate GitHub textile preview

This is a replacement for the normal "TextMate":http://macromates.com/ Textile bundle "Preview" command. It adds a "RedCloth":http://redcloth.org/ extension to parse the custom GitHub markup for Wiki links and code blocks. Like this:

[[A wiki link]]

``` some language
Some code goes here
```

To use it, replace (or make a new version of) the Preview command at *Bundles -> Bundle Editor -> Show Bundle Editor -> Textile*

Even better, if this file is kept as a separate executable, it can be used for a "live" preview via the *Window -> Show Web Preview* command.

This pairs nicely with a "custom TextMate theme":http://fgnass.posterous.com/github-markdown-preview by @fgnass@ that applies the GitHub CSS rules.
